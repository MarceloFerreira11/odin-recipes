    <h4>Mushroom Stew in its final form</h4>

    <p>Mushrooms simmered with onions, wine, and carrots make for a rich, French-style stew. Serve with egg noodles, polenta, or mashed potatoes</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces shiitake mushrooms, chopped</li>

        <li>8 ounces oyster mushrooms, chopped</li>

        <li>2 cups roughly chopped onion</li>

        <li>6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided, or to taste

            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

            <li>1large leek, white and light green parts only, diced

            <li>2 medium carrots, thinly sliced

            <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed and minced

            <li> tablespoon tomato paste

            <li>2 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour

            <li> ½ cups dry red wine

            <li> ½ cups vegetable broth

            <li> tablespoon tamari, or to taste

            <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste

            <li> sprigs fresh thyme, chopped

            <li>2 bay leaves, or more to taste
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine all four mushroom types in a large bowl with onions; toss gently to mix.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a very large pot over medium-high heat. Cover the bottom of the pot with one layer of the mushroom-onion mixture. Cook, without moving them around too much, until they begin to brown and caramelize on one side, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir and cook another 3 to 5 minutes to brown the other side. Transfer to a large bowl using a slotted spoon. Add 2 tablespoons oil to the pot, and repeat with another batch. Continue until all mushrooms and onions are cooked.</li>
        <li>Season mushroom-onion mixture with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Add wine, vegetable broth, tamari, cayenne, thyme, and bay leaves, and scrape up the brown bits at the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Carefully add the mushroom-onion mixture. Bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low and simmer, partly covered, until carrots and onions are tender and sauce has thickened, 30 to 40 minutes.</li>

    </ol>
